What is a Closure?
A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment).
When you create a closure, you gain access to an outer functionâ€™s scope from an inner function. Closures are automatically created every time a function is defined in JavaScript.
