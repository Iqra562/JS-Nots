undefined
When a variable is declared but not initialized, or when a function does not return a value, the variable or the functionâ€™s result is undefined.
Accessing an object property or array element that does not exist also results in undefined.
It is a primitive value.



null
It is a deliberate assignment that represents the absence of any object value.
It is often used to explicitly indicate that a variable or object property should have no value or no reference to any object.
It is also a primitive value.
